# gamehax.h

gamehax.h is a one file (for now), easy to import "library" for C++ that allows game hackers to mess with memory and stuff alot easier.

This is especially good for beginners who don't know how to use WriteProcessMemory or ReadProcessMemory.

It also contains functions like "print", which means you don't have to constantly go "std::cout << "Insert text here" << std::endl;" but instead go "print("hello")" like in lua.
