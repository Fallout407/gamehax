# gamehax.h

### gamehax.h is a one file, easy to import library / function pack for C++ that allows game hackers to mess with memory and stuff alot easier.

### This is especially good for beginners who don't know how to use WriteProcessMemory or ReadProcessMemory. (this functions pack adds a readMem (1 arg) function and a writeMem (2 args) function.)

### It also contains ease-of-access like functions like 'print' and 'wait' that are purely there to make things easier for beginners.

## Current functions list:

### print("Text here")

### wait(seconds)

### hookToProcess("Window name") -- This function also selects what program to memory edit.

### writeMem(address, value)

### readMem(address) -- Outputs reading to a variable called 'readOutput'.
